# News API SetUp

--Creating the environment variables

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).

You'll need to run npm install & setup-dbs (see scripts in package.json)
